= vlad-thin

Control thin with vlad.

This is thin's own <tt>example/vlad.rake</tt> (specifically http://github.com/macournoyer/thin/raw/56c9b3eb2553ef6f6784768a3265d6562ab87b0f/example/vlad.rake) in a gem.  Don't ask me why it wasn't already in one..

Yell at me (via an issue) if thin’s bundled vlad.rake changes, I’m totally not paying attention.
